CzechFOI-DRATE: Exploring ways to minimize bias when dividing real-world data into two groups (vaccinated vx /unvaccinated uvx)
<br>

**Hypothesis:
It is impossible to perfectly and fairly compare vaccinated (VX) and unvaccinated (UVX) groups — either by measurement or mathematically — when vaccination is time-dependent and not random. This remains true even if both groups have the same homogen individual death rates.**

### Software Requirements:

These scripts don't require SQLite queries to aggregate the 11 million individual data rows.
Instead, the aggregation is handled directly by Python scripts, which can generate aggregated CSV files very quickly.

- [Python 3.12.5](https://www.python.org/downloads/) to run the scripts.
- [Visual Studio Code 1.92.2](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) to edit and run scripts.


### Disclaimer:
**The results have not been checked for errors. Neither methodological nor technical checks or data cleansing have been performed.**
